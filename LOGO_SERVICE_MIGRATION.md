# Logo Service Migration: Clearbit â†’ Logo.dev

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the migration from Clearbit's logo service to Logo.dev for fetching company logos in the JobTracker application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Company Suggestions Data (`/front-end/src/data/companySuggestions.jsx`)
- Updated all hardcoded logo URLs from `https://logo.clearbit.com/` to `https://img.logo.dev/`
- Added API token parameter `?token=pk_X-1ZO13GSgeOoUrIuJ6GMQ` to all URLs
- Updated the `getCompanyLogo()` function to generate Logo.dev URLs for dynamic company names

### 2. TrackerPage Component (`/front-end/src/TrackerPage.jsx`)
- Updated all dynamic logo URL generation from Clearbit to Logo.dev
- Added API token to all generated URLs
- Updated logo fetching logic in company search and job creation flows

## API Token

**Important**: The current implementation uses a placeholder API token (`pk_X-1ZO13GSgeOoUrIuJ6GMQ`). 

### Next Steps:
1. **Get a real Logo.dev API token** by signing up at https://logo.dev
2. **Replace the placeholder token** with your actual API token
3. **Consider storing the token as an environment variable** for security

### Recommended Environment Variable Setup:
```env
# In .env file
VITE_LOGO_DEV_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

Then update the code to use:
```javascript
const token = import.meta.env.VITE_LOGO_DEV_TOKEN || 'pk_X-1ZO13GSgeOoUrIuJ6GMQ';
const logoUrl = `https://img.logo.dev/${domain}?token=${token}`;
```

## Benefits of Logo.dev over Clearbit

1. **Active Development**: Logo.dev is actively maintained and updated
2. **Better API**: More reliable service with better uptime
3. **Pricing**: More competitive pricing structure
4. **Support**: Better customer support and documentation

## Testing

After deploying these changes:
1. Test company logo loading for existing job entries
2. Test logo fetching when adding new companies
3. Verify fallback behavior for companies without logos
4. Check that the API token is working correctly
