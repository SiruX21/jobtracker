- something to track your intern/job applications
- uses fancy tech stack blah blah blah
- in theory should use account authentication and creation but we shall find out
- in theory should also be a proof of concept for a lot of what i know in a neat full stack project
- god forbid design we don't need that

# Stuff this project currently shows off

- github actions working properly with my own self-hosted server
- ssl working properly on my website on both ends, check it out [here](https://job.siru.dev)
